# Password Generator

## Repository Description

I was given the HTML and CSS files contained in this repo and refactored a JavaScript file to produce a randomly generated password. The website will ask the user for a password length and whether the user would like to include lower case characters, upper case characters, special characters, or numbers.

## Challenge Reflection

This is my first solo project working with JavaScript and it was an interesting experience getting to understand the language and its syntax. I hope to learn more about JavaScript and its potential going forward in the UT Coding Bootcamp.
